# Blaise TypeScript and React Guide

This repository contains an interactive guide to the tools used in the Blaise
frontend and NodeJS projects.

We use ReactJS for front-end projects and NodeJS with Express for backend
servers. Typically, the Node backend servers just provide the API for use by
frontend applications; most other backend applications are developed using
Python.

## The Tools

Typically, we use the following tools when working within the Javascript
ecosystem.

- **TypeScript**: A language which serves as a _superset_ of Javascript which
    adds a rich type-system.
- **React**: Declarative front-end framework used for build interactive 
    web-apps.
- **Express**: HTTP/web framework to serve up content from backend servers.
- **Jest**: Testing framework.
